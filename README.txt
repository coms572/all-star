===========================================================================
The objective of this project is to obtain an optimal 11-player
soccer team from two team against each other within a specified
budget.

This is the step by step process of running the AI techniques: 
Backtracking, Heuristic Backtracking and Local Search. There 
are four scripts, which have the following functionality:

1.)data.py - analyzing and sorting of data
2.)backtracking.py - to perform backtracking
3.)heuristic_backtrack.py - to perform backtracking based on 
			    heuristic optimization.
4.)local.py - to perform local hill climbing search.
===========================================================================
Requirements:
1.) Python.
2.) Libraries: pandas
===========================================================================
Inputs:
1.)Budget - Enter the budget in which the team should be accomodated.
	    It is preferred to have the budget between 800 to 1000.
2.)Team1 - Enter the first team.
3.)Team2 - Enter the second team.
===========================================================================
Running the scripts:

To obtain an optimal team we run the following scripts and compare their
performance. Running these scripts will prompt for inputs which have been
described above.

1.)python backtracking.py
2.)python heuristic_backtrack.py
3.)python local.py
===========================================================================
For reference to the sample outputs. Please check the "SampleOutputs"
folder for the screenshots of the outputs after executing each of these
scripts.
